# Partners Events Invite

# This App is written to help organizers arrange partner events
#Features

1. This App is responsible for fetching the partner's data from the endpoint
2. Submitting the best dates to organise partners' summit

# How does it calculate the best date?

The date you send in for the country should be the starting date of the two-day period where most partners can make it for both days in a row. In case of multiple dates with the same number of partners, pick the earlier date. If there are no two days in a row when any partners can make it, return null.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
